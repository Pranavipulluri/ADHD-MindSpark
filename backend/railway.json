# Railway Backend Configuration

This configuration tells Railway to:
- Use the `backend` folder as root directory
- Install dependencies with npm
- Start the server with `node server.js`
- Use `/health` endpoint for health checks

## Setup in Railway:

1. Go to your service → Settings → Source
2. Set **Root Directory**: `backend`
3. Railway will use this configuration automatically
